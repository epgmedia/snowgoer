<i>Snow Goer</i> will recognize weekly winners as well as champions for the seven snocross races combined, the four oval/enduro races combined and an overall high points season champion. These people will get a small prize package, as will winners of select individual rounds, including the Duluth Snocross opener, both I-500 races (cross-country and enduro) and the Eagle River World Championship.   <br /><br />
